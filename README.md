Hi, I’m @AREngineering an electronic engineering from Italy. 
I’m interested in the development of maker projects and in the creations of libraries and tools for 3d printing and microcontrollers programming. 
I’m currently learning how to proficiently program the STM32 micros, and making some experiments with digital design on FPGAs with VHDL. 
You can reach me at the e-mail address arengineering.it@gmail.com
